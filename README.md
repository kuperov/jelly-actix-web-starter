# Web starter template, based on [Jelly](https://github.com/secretkeysio/jelly-actix-web-starter)

This is my own personal adaptation of
[Jelly](https://github.com/secretkeysio/jelly-actix-web-starter), an
outstanding web starter template published by secretkeys.io.

While you're very welcome to use this code, I think it would be unwise. This
code was written to meet my own needs, and you should carefully assess whether
these line up with your own. Also, I'm a terrible programmer and this codebase
is likely littered with awful bugs that wouldn't be there if I were smarter. So
caveat emptor, look before you leap, etc. May I gently suggest you consider
basing your project on the original and far superior
[Jelly](https://github.com/secretkeysio/jelly-actix-web-starter) instead?

To be clear: this code comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY or claim of fitness
for any purpose whatsoever. If you elect to use it you do so at your own risk.

## What's This?

The Jelly project does a terrific job of building a bunch of much-needed
features on top of actix-web. These include user handling, forms, background
jobs, emails, flash messages, and a database layer. This project stands on the
shoulders of Jelly, and eventually aims to add additional requirements:

  * [ ] The final web app must be a single standalone binary,
  * [ ] The database layer must work with SQLite and psql,
  * [ ] Configuration tools should be built into the binary.

## More information

For now, the best source of information about this project is the
[Jelly README](https://github.com/secretkeysio/jelly-actix-web-starter/blob/trunk/README.md).
